uuh...

Installation is not yet possible (too lazy to write a Makefile.PL, also,
where should I put kgsmue/*.pl?), but running is.

Running kgsueme example client:

  make rundemo

Running the protocol tracer app (run it and connect to localhost instead
of kgs.kiseido.com):

  make trace

For the KGS modules, all you need is below the lib/ directory. It should not
need any special modules. A Makefile.PL for that could be wirtten trivially, but...

The sample client needs these (nonstandard) modules:

Audio::Data
Audio::Play
Gtk2

For Gtk2, I used the gtk-xs version (now on CPAN, so fetch it there).

You can also use the cvs version:

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gtk2-perl login
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gtk2-perl co gtk2-perl-xs
    # install gtk2-perl-xs/Glib module
    # install gtk2-perl-xs/Gtk2 module
