Standard perl module building:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Running kgsueme example client:

  kgsueme

Running the protocol tracer app (run it and connect to localhost instead
of kgs.kiseido.com):

  kgstrace

For the KGS modules, all you need is below the lib/ directory. It should not
need any special modules.

gtp-controller and kgstrace need these modules:

   Event

The sample client needs these (nonstandard) modules:

   Audio::Data
   Audio::Play
   Gtk2

For Gtk2, I used the gtk-xs version (now on CPAN, so fetch it there).
